# Aquamata

A post-10.12.4 macOS Sierra upgrade & post-install workflow, specifically designed for Jamf Pro deployment. Allows you to add additional scripts or installations after the Mac has finished upgrading when the user first logs in.

## Status

Note that this is very much a work in progress and I have not yet gotten around to making a simpler user customization experience. At this time this project is more of a template you can leverage than anything else. There will be additional documentation re: Jamf Pro policy configuration and macOS isntaller app packaging instructions. Feel free to poke around in the meantime.
